Hi, I'm Kelly! I'm a [Bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) PhD student in [Pat Schloss' Lab](http://www.schlosslab.org/) at the University of Michigan.

When I'm not doing science, you might find me volunteering with [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/), running, cycling, or moonlighting as a [live sound engineer](https://sovacool.dev/latex-cv/cv_sound_KLS.pdf).

You can check out the source code for this website in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kelly-sovacool/kelly-sovacool.github.io).
