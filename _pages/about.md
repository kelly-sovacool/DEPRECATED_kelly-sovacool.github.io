Hi, I'm Kelly!
I'm a [Bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) PhD student in
[Pat Schloss' Lab](http://www.schlosslab.org/) at the University of Michigan.
Iâ€™m interested in developing bioinformatics tools and data analysis pipelines for microbial ecology.

When I'm not doing science, you might find me volunteering with [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/),
helping or teaching at a [Software Carpentry](https://umswc.github.io/) workshop, [running or cycling](http://bit.ly/strava-kelly), or moonlighting as
a [live sound engineer](https://sovacool.dev/latex-cv/cv_sound_KLS.pdf).

You can check out my public projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kelly-sovacool)!
