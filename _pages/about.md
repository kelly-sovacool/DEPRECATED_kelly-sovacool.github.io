Hi, I'm Kelly! I'm a PhD student in the [Department](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan.

When I'm not doing science, you might find me running, cycling, volunteering with [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/), or moonlighting as a [live sound engineer](kelly-sovacool.github.io/files/cv_sound_KLS.pdf).

You can check out the source code for this website in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kelly-sovacool/kelly-sovacool.github.io).
